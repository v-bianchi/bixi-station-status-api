    <h1>BIXI Montreal station status intermediary API</h1>
    <p>
      This is an intermediary API created to retrieve more concise responses from the BIXI Montreal original station status API (https://api-core.bixi.com/gbfs/en/station_status.json).
    </p>
    <p>
      The original API's response is about 155kb, being quite hard to handle by microcontrollers.
